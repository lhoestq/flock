# Getting Started With Flock

Flock as a DuckDB extension is designed to simplify the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into your data
workflows. This guide will help you get started with Flock, covering installation, setup, and basic usage.

## Install DuckDB

To install Duckdb, it's an easy process you need just to
visit [DuckDB Installation Page](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/) and choose the installation options that
represent your environment, by specifying:

- **Version**: Stable or Preview.
- **Environment**: CLI, Python, R, etc.
- **Platform**: Linux, MacOS or Windows.
- **Download Method**: Direct or Package Manager.

After installing DuckDB, you can verify the installation and get started by following
the [DuckDB CLI Overview](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html/).

## Install Flock Extension

At this stage you should have a running DuckDB instance (DuckDB **v1.4.4 or later**). Flock can be installed in two ways:

### Option 1: Install from Community Extension (Recommended)

To install Flock from DuckDB's community catalog, run the following SQL commands in your DuckDB instance:

```sql
INSTALL
flock FROM community;
LOAD
flock;
```

This will install the Flock extension and load it into your DuckDB environment.

### Option 2: Build from Source

If you want to build Flock from source or contribute to the project, you can use our automated build script:

1. **Clone the repository with submodules:**
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/dais-polymtl/flock.git
   cd flock
   ```

   Or if you've already cloned without submodules:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Run the build and run script:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build_and_run.sh
   ```

   This interactive script will guide you through:
   - Checking prerequisites (CMake, build tools, compilers)
   - Setting up vcpkg (dependency manager)
   - Building the project (Debug or Release mode)
   - Running DuckDB with the Flock extension

   The script automatically detects your system configuration and uses the appropriate build tools (Ninja or Make).

3. **The script will launch DuckDB** with the Flock extension ready to use. Make sure to check the [documentation](https://dais-polymtl.github.io/flock/docs/what-is-flock) for usage examples.

**Requirements for building from source:**
- CMake (3.5 or later)
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Build system (Ninja or Make)
- Git
- Python 3 (optional, for integration tests)

**Note:** The build script will handle most of the setup automatically, including vcpkg configuration and dependency management.

## Set Up API Keys for Providers

To use Flock functions, you need to set up API keys for the providers you plan to use. Flock supports multiple providers
such as **OpenAI**, **Azure**, **Ollama**, and **Anthropic/Claude**.

Refer to the following sections for detailed instructions on setting up API keys for each provider.
